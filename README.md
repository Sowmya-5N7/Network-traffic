# Analysing Network Traffic Using WireShark

## Objective
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark, analyze the captured packets, and identify different network protocols (such as HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.) to understand basic network communication patterns.

-  Helps in understanding how devices communicate over a network.
-  Useful for troubleshooting, security analysis, and learning protocol behaviors.

## Tools used
-  Wireshark

## How to use
-  Open `.pcap` files in Wireshark to inspect traffic.
-  Refer to the report for protocol details.
